                                    A few months back, we were scammed by some scammers because we became greedy and lost almost $3 million.
                                </div>
                                <br />
                                <div class="heading-text">
                                    We filed a police case to the cybercrime department and took their help to catch scammers but unfortunately, we could not do anything because of the decentralized, irreversible & anonymous nature of
                                    crypto.
                                </div>
                                <br />
                                <div class="heading-text">
                                    We contacted some international agencies of the world also, but again nothing was found.
                                </div>
                                <br />
                                <div class="heading-text">
                                    From that day, we accepted that it is very difficult to catch the scammers if they are really smart.
                                </div>
                                <br />
                                <div class="heading-text">
                                    Day by day the frauds and scammers are increasing because they find this very easy and lucrative. They are not caught even.
                                </div>
                                <br />
                                <div class="heading-text">
                                    Crime Rates & Criminals are increasing. People from the crypto industry are scammed with big amounts. What they believe that it is very easy to scam and run away without any clue.
                                </div>
                                <br />
                                <div class="heading-text">
                                    We made research on scams and scammers in the crypto industry, We made some surveys also about scams and Ponzi schemes too. We found some shocking results. We found that many innocent poor, middle-class
                                    people lost too much amount that they committed suicide also.
                                </div>
                                <br />
                                <div class="heading-text">
                                    These are not the suicides but rather they are the murders by the scammers. This is the murder of humanity. This must be stopped. We must do something to stop this.
                                </div>
                                <br />
                                <div class="heading-text">
                                    So, we thought to protect others who can be the scammers’ next target. And started thinking about a unique initiative that can protect people who involve in the crypto industry and can easily be scammed.
                                    We are not sure what will we achieve or how many people can we save but we are very much sure that at least this initiative will provide a platform to protect innocent people.

                                <br />
                                <div class="heading-text">
                                    If we succeed to save even a single person’s life, we will consider this initiative to be successful. Because If we save one person that means we are saving humanity. And that would be the biggest reward
                                    for us.
